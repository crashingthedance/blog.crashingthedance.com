<p>Since we only have 22 days and counting (according to the <a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/">official Crashing the Dance countdown clock</a>) until Selection Sunday, I thought I'd go ahead and unleash the &quot;team sheet&quot; profile pages I <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2009/02/georgetown-on-my-mind.html">hinted about Wednesday</a>. They're not quite complete (please <a href="mailto:feedback@crashingthedance.com">send</a> any feedback my way) but I'd rather have something than nothing for you, my loyal reader(s).</p>

<p>The Crashing the Dance team profiles are loosely based on the description and sample of the NCAA selection committee team profile sheets <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/seth_davis/03/08/hoop.thoughts/index.html" target='_blank'>described by SI.com's Seth Davis</a> during the 2007 bracket season (and <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/luke_winn/03/09/inside.bkc/index.html" target='_blank'>mentioned</a> in 2005 by Luke Winn). They may well have changed some since then, but without examples to the contrary I'll assume it's still roughly the same.</p>

<p>You can get to the team sheets from the selection, seed, and distance lists. Enjoy!</p>
