<p>Many of the teams who needed to make a statement this week are certainly making one.</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile128.shtml">Kansas State</a>: loses 77-71 Tuesday to fellow bubble-dweller Oklahoma State</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile95.shtml">Georgetown</a>: loses 59-56 Tuesday to St. John's</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile49.shtml">Cincinnati</a>: loses 70-59 Tuesday to South Florida</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile154.shtml">Maryland</a>: loses 65-63 Tuesday at home to Wake Forest</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile161.shtml">Miami</a>: loses 78-68 Wednesday to Georgia Tech</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile26.shtml">Boston College</a>: loses 74-69 Wednesday to N.C. State</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile131.shtml">Kentucky</a>: loses 90-85 Wednesday at home to Georgia</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile84.shtml">Florida</a>: loses 80-71 Wednesday to Mississippi State</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile326.shtml">Wisconsin</a>: loses 51-46 Wednesday to fellow bubble-dweller Minnesota</p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile312.shtml">Virginia Tech</a>: loses 86-78 at home Wednesday to North Carolina</p>

<p>It's one thing to lose now or in your conference tournament to a team that's already in, but to lose to the likes of South Florida and Georgia Tech (no offense to RPI #167 South Florida and #162 Georgia Tech) while trying to make your closing argument gives you little reason to complain when the jury comes back against you.</p>

<p>It's going to be a tough bubble to predict.</p>
