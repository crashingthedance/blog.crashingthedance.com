<p>With the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/seth_davis/02/17/hoop.thoughts/index.html">weak bubble</a> developing this year, some teams will make it in that wouldn't in other years. One team that CTD currently has in that made me scratch my head a bit is Georgetown. Let's take a look. (All numbers through Tuesday's games.)</p>

<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Pros</b></p>

<p>The Hoyas are ranked 32nd by Sagarin and 39th in RPI. Since 2000, only 4% of the eligible teams (Georgia ranked 15th in 2003 but <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/news/2003/03/10/georgiasuspends_harrick_ap/">declared themselves ineligible</a>) ranked 35th or better by Sagarin were left out of the bracket. However, only 8 of 13 such teams with a winning percentage of 60% or worse were selected. Fortunately, the Hoyas' tough schedule eases up a bit at the end, so they have a chance to improve that a bit. Pomeroy (which ranks them 22nd) has the <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?y=2009&amp;team=Georgetown">Hoyas finishing</a> 17-12, but that will require them to steal one from the Marquette/Louisville/Villanova group.</p>
<p>The Hoyas have a strong non-conference resum&eacute;, ranked 8th in non-conference RPI and 14th in non-conference SOS. Part of that is only playing two games against RPI 201+ teams, but they do have a win over an underrated Memphis team.</p>
<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Cons</b></p>
<p>The big problem for the Hoyas is their conference performance. Despite (actually because of) the strength of the Big East, their 4-8 conference record ranks them 83rd in conference RPI. And that's not good. If we only consider RPI top 105 teams (the lowest RPI to get in was #74 New Mexico in 1999), only 3% of teams with conference RPI ranks of 75th or worse were at-large selections (or would have been based on their seeds).</p>
<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>?</b></p>
<p>Some of the other parts of their profile are just plain confusing. They have three wins over RPI top 25 teams (only 11 teams have three or more), but are 3-6 against the RPI top 50 (OK) and 6-10 against the RPI top 100 (worse). The 6 top 100 wins are good, but taking 16 games to get those 6 wins is not. The +1 differential on RPI top 200 games (11-10) isn't going to help either.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, here's a sneak preview of a new feature I'm working on for the stretch run. This is a look at <a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile95.shtml" target='_blank'>Georgetown's profile</a> based on the <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/seth_davis/03/08/hoop.thoughts/index.html" target='_blank'>team sheets used by the selection committee</a>.
