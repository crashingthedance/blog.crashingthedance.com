<p>Nate Silver, fresh off his 50 for 50 performance in <a target="_blank" href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/fivethirtyeights-2012-forecast/">forecasting the 2012 presidential election</a>, is in his third year of publishing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/18/sports/ncaabasketball/nate-bracket.html">NCAA tournament probabilities</a>. Likewise, we're in our <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2011/03/so-youre-saying-theres-a-chance.php">third</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2012/03/second-chance.php">year</a> of using those to calculate the probabilities of interesting results starting with the Sweet 16.</p>

<p><b>47.8%</b> probability of a #1 seed winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>19 champs have been #1 seeds - most since seeding began in 1979</p>
<p><b>6.7%</b> probability of three #1 seeds in the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>Three or more #1 seeds have made it four times since seeding began </p>
<p><b>14.5%</b> probability of no #1 seeds in the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>A #1-free Final Four has happened three times since seeding began (last in 2011)</p>
<p><b>19.9%</b> probability of a Louisville vs. Florida final</p>
<p class='indent'>The most likely championship game pairing</p>
<p><b>15.2%</b> probability of #2 seed winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>Six champs have been #2 seeds - second most since seeding began</p>
<p><b>25.3%</b> probability of #3 seed winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>The 2011 champion (UConn) was a #3 seed. Florida (21.3%) accounts for most of this chance.</p>
<p><b>6.8%</b> probability of a #12 seed or lower in the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>The lowest team to make a Final Four is an #11 seed (George Mason 2006, VCU 2011).</p>
<p><b>3.6%</b> probability of a first time national champion</p>
<p class='indent'>Miami, Wichita State, and Florida Gulf Coast are the only schools left wihtout a championship. The other 13 schools have a combined 25 championships.</p>
<p><b>7.1%</b> probability of all-B1G <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>Final Four</span> championship game matchup (Corrected)</p>
<p class='indent'>One Big Ten team has won the national championship in the last 23 seasons (2000 Michigan State)</p>
<p><b>3.6%</b> probability of both remaining ACC teams making the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>More likely, there is an 65.7% chance neither will</p>
<p><b>0.4%</b> probability of all-B1G Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>The 1985 Final Four saw three teams from the Big East.</p>
<p><b>5.7%</b> probability of a rematch of the 2007 Florida/Ohio State championship game</p>
<p><b>100%</b> probability of a Sweet 16 rematch of the 1987 Indiana/Syracuse championship game (just making sure you're paying attention)</p>
