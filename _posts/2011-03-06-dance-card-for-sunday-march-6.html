<p>Sunday is a slow day on the calendar. Only one conference championship game today, and few games with bubble implications. Seven days to Selection Sunday.</p>

<b>Who clinched automatic bids yesterday</b>
<ul>
<li>Atlantic Sun - <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile21.shtml">Belmont</a></b> 87, North Florida 46</li>
<li>Big South - <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile181.shtml">UNC Asheville</a></b> 60, Coastal Carolina 47</li>
<li>Ohio Valley - <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile176.shtml">Morehead State</a></b> 80, Tennessee Tech 73</li>
</ul>

<b>Who helped themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile104.shtml">Harvard</a></li>
<p>The Crimson clinched at least a share of first place in the Ivy League. Princeton must now win Wednesday at Penn to force a one-game playoff for the automatic bid.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile207.shtml">Notre Dame</a></li>
<p>Notre Dame withstood a Connecticut run after Ben Hansbrough fouled out with 8:24 left. Barring a complete collapse in the Big East tourney, the Irish are in good shape for a #2 seed at worse.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile3.shtml">Alabama</a></li>
<p>Despite a 12-4 conference record and the SEC West crown, Alabama has one of the more hotly-debated at-large <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile3.shtml">profiles</a>. Their win over likely at-large Georgia won't hurt, but they still have work to do in Atlanta.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile163.shtml">Michigan</a></li>

</ul>

<b>Who hurt themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile95.shtml">Georgetown</a> 17th on the CtD S-Curve (#5 seed) </li>
<p>The free fall continues for the Hoyas after point guard Chris Wright broke his hand on February 23. Georgetown has dropped four of their last five. All have been to tournament teams, but two were at home and yesterday's 22-point loss at Cincinnati won't impress the committee regardless of Wright's status. He expects to return for the NCAA tournament, and Georgetown will certainly let the committe know that.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile227.shtml">Purdue</a> 6th on the CtD S-Curve (#2 seed) </li>
<p>A loss at Big Ten cellar-dwellar Iowa cost Purdue any hope they had at sneaking up to the #1 seed line.</p>
</ul>

<b>Who clinches today</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Missouri Valley</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile117.shtml">Indiana State</a> vs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile172.shtml">Missouri State</a></li>
<p>Despite inexplicably picking up a few votes in this week's coaches poll, Missouri State likely won't make the field without a win over Indiana State.</p>
</ul>

<b>Other big games today</b>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile326.shtml">Wisconsin</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile210.shtml">Ohio State</a></li>
<p>The Buckeyes are currently the #1 overall seed in CtD's eyes, and will be hard to knock off the #1 seed line if they pick up the win on senior day.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile131.shtml">Kentucky</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile275.shtml">Tennessee</a></li>
<p>Tennessee's travails have been well-documented this season. I'm not sure a home loss to Kentucky make them fall back on the bubble, but they don't have much room for error.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile88.shtml">Florida State</a> at North Carolina State and Wake Forest at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile26.shtml">Boston College</a></li>
<p>The ACC's mediocrity (by its own standards, anyway) has also been well-documented. If Florida State and Boston College have any hope at an at-large bid, neither can afford to slip up.</p>
</ul>
