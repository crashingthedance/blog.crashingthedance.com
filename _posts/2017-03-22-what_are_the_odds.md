After taking a hiatus last year, it's once again time to play around with the
[FiveThirtyEight predictions](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-march-madness-predictions/)
and have some fun with the numbers.

**42.4%** probability of a #1 seed winning the championship

> 21 champs have been #1 seeds - most since seeding began in 1979

**20.0%** probability of a #2 seed winning the championship

> Seven champs have been #2 seeds - second most since seeding began

**10.2%** probability of a #3 seed winning the championship

> Five champs have been #3 seeds

**17.6%** probability of a #4 seed winning the championship

> The only #4 seed to win a title was Arizona in 1997.

**9.9%** probability of a #5 or lower seed winning the championship

> Only four previous champions (#6 N.C. State 1983, #6 Kansas 1988, #7
> Connecticut 2014, #8 Villanova 1985) were seeded 5th or lower.

**36.4%** probability of a first-time champion

> Gonzaga, Baylor, West Virginia, Purdue, Butler, South Carolina, and Xavier
> would win their first title.

**34.5%** probability of the champion emerging from the West Region

> Gonzaga (18.2% percent chance) gives the West the best shot at producing the
> champ.

**13.2%** probability of the champion emerging from the East Region

> Losing the #1 and #2 seeds was costly to the chances the eventual champion
> will pass through Madison Square Garden this week.

**8.3%** probability of three #1 seeds in the Final Four

> Three or more #1 seeds have made it to the Final Four five times since
> seeding began (last in 2015)

**16.7%** probability of no #1 seeds in the Final Four

> A #1-free Final Four has happened three times since seeding began (last in
> 2011)

**5.5%** probability of no returning Elite 8 teams from 2016

**65.7%** probability of no returning Final Four teams from 2016

> Kansas, North Carolina, and Oregon are the only 2016 Elite 8 teams remaining
> this year. Only UNC made the Final Four last year.

**38.0%** probability of no #4 seeds in the Final Four

**0.1%** probability of four #4 seeds in the Final Four

> All four #4 seeds are in the Sweet 16 for only the third time since seeding
> began.

**8.9%** probability of a Gonzaga vs. Kansas championship game

> The most likely championship game pairing

**45.9%** probability of a North Carolina vs. Kentucky South Regional final

> This is the most likely regional final matchup this season

**1.1%** probability of a rematch of the 2006 UCLA/Florida championship game

**3.5%** probability of a rematch of the 1997 Arizona/Kentucky championship game

**1.9%** probability of a rematch of the 1948 Kentucky/Baylor championship game

championship game

**18.2%** probability of a Final Four rematch of the 1957 UNC/Kansas
championship game

**22.0%** probability of a Elite 8 rematch of the 1968 UCLA/UNC championship

> would bring back memories for those who remember the original.

**2.5%** probability of three Big 12 teams in the Final Four

**0.9%** probability of three Big 10 teams in the Final Four

**0.4%** probability of three Pac 12 teams in the Final Four
