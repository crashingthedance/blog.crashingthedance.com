<p>We're going to try a little experiment here.</p>

<p>I frequently have trouble posting on the blog because I try to do too much. So as we draw closer to Selection Sunday, I'm going to write smaller more frequent posts and lay off the essays.</p>

<p>I'll start by doing something I expect to repeat over the next three weeks and look at one team at a time. I'll shine some light on how the model is interpreting their profile, whether I think the model is right, and what the rest of the schedule has in store for that team.</p>

<p>We start this week with Wisconsin. Feel free to familiarize yourself with the Badgers' <a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/profile326.shtml" target='_blank'>profile</a>.</p>

<p>Several things jump out at me. First, Wisconsin is ranked in the top 30 in both RPI and Sagarin, and their RPI against conference (capturing imbalanced conference schedules) and non-conference opponents (capturing not only non-conference strength of schedule, but how they performed against that schedule) each rank in the top 40.</p>

<p>The nitty gritty data I use to train the model goes back to 2000, and of the 249 teams with an RPI rank of 40th or better and both conference and non-conference RPI ranks of 50th or better, only 6 (2.4%) did not make the field as at-large (or were automatic qualifiers and would not have been selected at-large based on their seeds).</p>

<table border='1'>
<tr style='font-weight:bold;'>
<td rowspan='2'>Team</td><td rowspan='2'>Year</td><td colspan='3' style='text-align: center;'>RPI</td></tr>
<tr style='font-weight:bold;'><td>All</td><td>Conf</td><td>Non-conf</td></tr>
</tr>
<tr><td>Kent St.</td><td>2000</td><td style='text-align:right;'>36</td><td style='text-align:right;'>18</td><td style='text-align:right;'>48</td></tr>
<tr><td>Missouri St.</td><td>2000</td><td style='text-align:right;'>34</td><td style='text-align:right;'>44</td><td style='text-align:right;'>40</td></tr>
<tr><td>San Diego St.</td><td>2002</td><td style='text-align:right;'>39</td><td style='text-align:right;'>44</td><td style='text-align:right;'>46</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vermont</td><td>2005</td><td style='text-align:right;'>26</td><td style='text-align:right;'>36</td><td style='text-align:right;'>43</td></tr>
<tr><td>Creighton</td><td>2006</td><td style='text-align:right;'>39</td><td style='text-align:right;'>24</td><td style='text-align:right;'>46</td></tr>
<tr><td>Missouri St.</td><td>2007</td><td style='text-align:right;'>35</td><td style='text-align:right;'>41</td><td style='text-align:right;'>42</td></tr>
</table>

<p>As you may have noticed, all six are from non-BCS conferences, so as long as Wisconsin doesn't stray too far from their current ranks, they should be in.</p>

<p>The other is that the Badgers are 2-8 against RPI Top 50 teams. Two wins is pretty good (only about 10% of teams since 2000 ranked 50th or better with two or more RPI top 50 wins weren't at-large selections), but they also have eight losses (about 20% of teams since 2000 ranked 50th or better with two or more RPI top 50 wins and seven or more RPI top 50 losses weren't at-large selections). Combined with their 6-1 record against teams ranked 51-100, they still have some room for error in the closing weeks.</p>
