* The [CTD selection model](http://crashingthedance.com/selection) currently has
Temple as the first team out of the field,
but it wouldn't surprise me to see them in the field. I'm not sure what it is in
their profile aside from the win over Kansas that has some with the Owls firmly
in the field. They have a [decent profile](http://crashingthedance.com/teams/274),
but one game shouldn't overwhelm the other 32.

* Each of the next five candidates on the [CTD seeding
  list](http://crashingthedance.com/seeding) behind Kentucky has a case at a #1
  seed, and I wouldn't be surprised to see any combination of those five fill
  out the final three spots. However, while Arizona is considered by some to be
  one of the best two or three teams right now, the committee generally rewards
  the entire season's profile rather than recent acheivements. All things being
  equal, Arizona's recent surge might be enough, but I can't get over those
  three losses to teams below 100 on the RPI list. No team with more than one
  such loss received a #1 seed in the 15 years of historical CTD data.
