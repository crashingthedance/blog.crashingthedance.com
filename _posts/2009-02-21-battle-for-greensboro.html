<p>Last year, the bracket battle among ACC teams (Triangle teams, really) was for the two Raleigh pod slots and the <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/02/going-to-caroli.html">Charlotte regional</a>. This year, four ACC teams are battling it out (with a few others) for two slots in the Greensboro pod.</p>

<p>After North Carolina lost their first two conference games, it looked like Wake Forest and Duke might have the best chance at Greensboro, with Clemson not far behind. Now, with the Heels having run off <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=North%20Carolina">10 straight wins</a> after the 0-2 start, one of the slots could be locked up soon.</p>

<p>The other three teams currently sport 7-4 records, with Clemson and Duke each getting another shot at Wake down the stretch, and the Devils traveling to the Dean Dome on Psycho T's Senior Day. (And wouldn't they love some revenge for J.J. Redick's Senior Day.) If one of those three finishes alone in second place in the ACC, they could have the early lead on the other Greensboro slot. Otherwise it will come down to the ACC Tournament in the friendly confines of the Georgia Dome.</p>

<p>Pomeroy has <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?y=2009&amp;team=Duke" target='_blank'>Duke</a> and <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?y=2009&amp;team=Clemson" target='_blank'>Clemson</a> finishing 11-5, with <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?y=2009&amp;team=Wake%20Forest" target='_blank'>Wake</a> at 10-6. Clemson already has the <a href="http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/021203aad.html" target='_blank'>tiebreaker</a> over Duke, and Duke has to beat Wake Sunday to avoid going 0-for-tiebreaker. (There are other teams that could well finish tied with or ahead of these three, but none have a realistic shot at Greensboro.) My guess is that it won't be settled until Atlanta.</p>
