<p>There's still nothing like a <a target='_new' href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h1W8dcUP9H70AmlSfDSenPteDT9gD8VB5E900">nighttime space shuttle launch</a>. Wow.</p>

<p>While the Endeavour had a good night, it was a rough night for the bubble teams. With Gonzaga and South Alabama taken down in their respective conference tournaments, two strong (if not certain) at-large candidates that would have received automatic bids were tossed into the at-large pool. That means likely two fewer spots for that weak bubble I <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/03/weak-bubble.html">discussed last week</a>.</p>

<p>I don't like throwing around the "lock" label, but Gonzaga is in. <a target='_new' href="http://www.kenpom.com/sked.php?&amp;y=2008&amp;team=South%20Alabama">USA</a> is a little more tricky. I week ago I would have felt better about the Jaguars' chances, but they're now 53rd in the Sagarin ratings and just 4-3 against the RPI Top 100 and several bad losses with no great wins <img src='http://www.sportvis.com/ctd/sparklineRPI249-2008-03-11.png' /> to speak of.</p>

<p>With strong showings later this week by some of the other bubble teams or more losses by the more one-bid conference leaders (I'm looking at you Butler, BYU and Kent State), the Jags could still be sitting on the launch pad come Sunday night.</p>
