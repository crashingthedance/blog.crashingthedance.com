<p>Now that the bracket is set, let's use Net Efficiency Margin (NEM was <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2009/03/accounting-for-injuries.html" target='_blank'>introduced last season</a>) to analyze the matchups and challenge some conventional wisdom. NEM is based on <a href="http://kenpom.com/stats.php" target="_blank">Ken Pomeroy's efficiency stats</a>, and factors out game site, game tempo, and opponent strength to allow game-by-game comparisons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's obvious that Purdue is not the same team without Robbie Hummel. While the five game post-Hummel sample is not enough to draw significant conclusions, let's take a look anyway. I've omitted the Minnesota game in which Hummel was injured.</p>

<table border='1' style='text-align:right'>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Games</th><th>NEM</th><th>OffNEM</th></tr>
<tr><th>With Hummel</th><td>26</td><td>27.4</td><td>12.1</td></tr>
<tr><th>Without</th><td>5</td><td>10.8</td><td>-5.6</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Purdue had enough trouble scoring before Hummel's injury, but without him they've been a below-average Division I team on offense. The Boilermakers are still a top 25 defensive team, but if they want to advance to Houston or beyond, they need to find a way to put points on the board.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Don't be so quick to pick against Wisconsin because of their troubles away from Madison.</p>
<table border='1' style='text-align:right'>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Games</th><th>NEM</th><th>DefNEM</th></tr>
<tr><th>Home</th><td>17</td><td>31.4</td><td>-15.4</td></tr>
<tr><th>Road/neutral</th><td>17</td><td>25.9</td><td>-13.3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Badgers are a little over 5 points per 100 possessions better in Madison overall,  with about 2 of those on defense. That would still place them defensively in the top 20 in adjusted efficiency, which makes them a strong candidate to make a deep run.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On the other hand, #1 seed Duke has a more obvious problem on the road. Last month I <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2010/02/quick-steps-on-the-road-again.html" target="_blank">took a look</a> at Duke's home/neutral/road spread and found a signifcant difference between their play at Cameron Indoor Stadium and road games.</p>
<p>While the gap has diminished some since then, it is still there, and is primarily driven by offense.</p>

<table border='1' style='text-align:right'>
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Games</th><th>NEM</th><th>OffNEM</th></tr>
<tr><th>Home</th><td>17</td><td>40.3</td><td>25.9</td></tr>
<tr><th>Road/neutral</th><td>17</td><td>31.2</td><td>14.7</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The Blue Devils, which have the <a href="http://kenpom.com/stats.php?y=2010&amp;s=8" target="_blank">best offense</a> in the country, are scoring roughly 11 points fewer per 100 possessions away from Cameron. Of course, this makes them a very, very good offensive team rather than an elite one, but without a site close to home this year, it's something to keep an eye on.</p>

</ul>
