<p>This game could be the ultimate test of the value of a good team on a hot streak against a consistently strong team.</p>

<p>VCU has been playing out of their minds offensively in March, and the defense hasn't been too shabby either.</p>

<p>Kansas is now the overwhelming favorite to win the national championship, with Nate Silver's <a target="_blank" href="http://ncaabracket.nytimes.com/2011/bracket/men/fivethirtyeight-forecast">538 bracket</a> showing their title chances close to 50% going into today. The Jayhawks have played increasingly better in the tournament according to NEM (28.5 vs. Boston University, 42.9 vs. Illinois and 48.3 vs. Richmond).</p>

<p>The last CAA team in the Elite 8 (George Mason in 2006) played that game against UConn a short drive from campus. A VCU win today would be the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.538host.com/allodds.png">most surprising upset</a> of this year's tournament, especially with the decided crowd advantage for Kansas, and would be a bigger upset than the last CAA team to make the Final Four.</p>
