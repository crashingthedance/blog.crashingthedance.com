<p>Last year, I put together the <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2011/03/so-youre-saying-theres-a-chance.php">probabilites of several interesting results</a> prior to the Sweet 16 based on Nate Silver's intial attempt at forecasting March Madness for the New York Times' FiveThirtyEight blog. Mr. Silver used a combination of computer power rankings and seeds, with adjustments for geography, injury, and other factors, to generate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/12/sports/ncaabasketball/201203-nate-silver-march-madness.html">probabilities</a> for each team reaching a particular round in the bracket.</p>

<p>I didn't have time to do this before Thursday night's games, but there are still some interesting outcomes to consider.</p>

<p>These all assume the outcome of each region is independent. I think my math is right, but feel free to correct me if you notice anything wrong.</p>

<p><b>44.9%</b> probability of a #1 seed winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>18 champs have been #1 seeds - most since seeding began in 1979</p>
<p><b>11.0%</b> probability of three #1 seeds in the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>Three or more #1 seeds have made it four times since seeding began </p>
<p><b>12.2%</b> probability of no #1 seeds in the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>A #1-free Final Four has happened three times since seeding began, including last season</p>
<p><b>16.5%</b> probability of a Kentucky vs. Ohio State final</p>
<p class='indent'>The most likely championship game pairing</p>
<p><b>31.5%</b> probability of #2 seed winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>Six champs have been #2 seeds - second most since seeding began</p>
<p><b>4.3%</b> probability of #3 seed (Baylor) winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>Last year's champion (UConn) was a #3 seed.</p>
<p><b>0.8%</b> probability of #10 seed or lower winning</p>
<p class='indent'>Villanova (#8 seed) in 1985 is the lowest seed to win the championship</p>
<p><b>34.8%</b> probability of all-SEC Final Four matchup (Kentucky vs. Florida)</p>
<p class='indent'>There has never been an all-SEC Final Four game, despite ten championships between three teams </p>
<p><b>8.8%</b> probability of both remaining Big 12 teams making the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>More likely, there is an 44.7% chance neither will</p>
<p><b>2.3%</b> probability of all-Big East final (Louisville vs. Syracuse)</p>
<p class='indent'>Would be the first since Villanova defeated Georgetown in 1985.</p>
<p><b>0%</b> probability of a rematch of last year's UConn/Butler championship game</p>
<p class='indent'>A championship game rematch has not happened since 1961 and 1962 (Cincinnati defeated Ohio State both years)</p>
<p><b>8.9%</b> probability of a rematch of the 2007 Florida/Ohio State championship game</p>
<p><b>15.8%</b> probability of a rematch (in the semifinals) of the 2003 Syracuse/Kansas championship game (in New Orleans)</p>
<p><b>6.3%</b> probability of a rematch of the 1996 Kentucky/Syracuse championship game</p>
<p><b>0.7%</b> probability of a rematch of the 1987 Indiana/Syracuse championship game (in New Orleans)</p>
<p><b>1.2%</b> probability of a rematch of the 1981 Indiana/North Carolina championship game</p>
<!--
<p><b>2.4%</b> probability of a rematch of the 1977 Marquette/North Carolina championship game</p>
<p><b>0.06%</b> probability of a rematch of the 1974 NC State/Marquette championship game</p>
