<p>Sorry for the late update Monday. I was traveling and did not have Internet access until  late afternoon.</p>

<p>I'm planning to post daily updates to the blog with comments on the previous day's results and their impact on the selection and seeding. I will also try to estimate the top 25 in the coaches poll daily to make it more like what we'll see on Selection Sunday. </p>

<p>More to follow soon.</p>
