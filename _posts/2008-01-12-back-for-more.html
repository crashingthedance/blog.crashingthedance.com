<p>Now that conference play has started, I've fired up the ole artificial intelligence box and started publishing (mostly) daily updates to the main site. I've (finally) updated the sidebar with a summary of last year's results and this year's highlights.</p>

<p>Before too long, I'll post more details about the good, the bad and the ugly from the 2007 predictions, and what they'll mean for 2008. Stay tuned!</p>
