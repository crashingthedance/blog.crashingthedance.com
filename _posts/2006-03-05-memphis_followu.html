<p>Memphis did their part to complicate the #1 seed line situation by losing Thursday to UAB, but the boost to their conference RPI from their last two opponents probably helped them more than the loss hurt.</p>

<p>Recall the <a href='http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2006/03/whither_memphis.html'>discussion</a> of using conference (and non-conference) RPI rank vs. the raw RPI. As of March 1, their conference RPI rank was so out of whack with those of previous #1 seeds that the Crashing The Dance Oracle<span style='font-size: small;vertical-align: super;'>TM</span> figured them a borderline #3/4 seed.</p>

<p>As a result, I switched to using raw RPI instead of rank, against the yelling of the voice inside my head. I felt dirty. As I wrote then, a .6000 conference RPI (like a .300 batting average in baseball) may not mean the same thing year-to-year, but a #5 conference RPI rank means the same thing every year: they had the 5th best conference RPI. For predicting from past data, it certainly makes more sense to use the rank to make comparisons fair across season.</p>

<p>I'm happy to report that I've switched back to using conference (and non-conference) RPI rank. All of our testing last season indicated that rank was a more accurate predictor than raw value. Plus, it just makes sense.</p>

<p>Anyway, with their last two games, Memphis improved from 48th (through March 1) to 27th (through March 4), which is more in line (though still below) previous #1 seeds. We'll have to see how a drop in the new polls hurts them.</p>

<p>This by no means makes them a lock for a #1. They need to watch their back for, among others, Texas, Illinois, George Washington, and (what?!?) North Carolina. Any of these four, with a strong conference tourney run, could sneak in if Memphis falters.</p>

<p>The CTD Oracle<span style='font-size: small;vertical-align: super;'>TM</span> currently puts UNC #6 overall in the S-Curve, a jump of 7 spots after last night's upset win in Durham. If they go on to win the ACC tournament, their 6 losses would not prohibit their chances of a #1 seed. Five teams (Arizona and Michigan State in 2000; Illinois in 2001; Oklahoma and Texas in 2003) got #1 seeds with 6 or more losses. The difference (see the points column on the <a href='http://www.crashingthedance.com/#seed'>S-Curve list</a>) between the four teams currently on the #2 line is slim, so any could jump to the #1 line should Memphis slip.</p>
