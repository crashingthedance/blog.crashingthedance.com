<p>Apologize for the tardiness of this post. The Crashing the Dance household has been fighting off that pesky spring cold.</p>

<p>After posting a pedestrian 7.9 NEM over their first 32 games, the Rams have blown it up since their March 6 CAA tournament win over George Mason. Their NCAA run has been no fluke; VCU's profile (35.5 overall NEM, 22.0 offensive and -13.5 defensive) has been similar to that of a top five profile. The big question is whether this is their new normal.</p>

<p>Butler has a -15.0 defensive NEM in their postseason games, but that may be a little misleading. The Bulldogs averaged a -35.5 defensive NEM in two of those games (March 8 vs. Wisconsin-Milwaukee and March 24 vs. Wisconsin), but only -5.7 in the others. Too bad for Butler that no other teams from <i>l'&eacute;tat fromage</i> are in the Final Four.</p>

<b>Connecticut vs. Kentucky</b>
<p>Immovable force, meet irresistible object.</p>

<p>Kentucky's defense is starting to live up to the Calipari reputation. The Wildcats have posted a defensive NEM of -13.5 during their current ten game winning streak.</p>

<p>The Huskies are the only one of the Final Four teams that hasn't shown a late-season defensive surge. With Kemba Walker's Big East and NCAA tournament performance, they haven't needed it so far. A 23.2 offensive NEM over those nine games will do that for you.</p>
