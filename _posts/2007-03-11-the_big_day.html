<p>Selection Sunday. The only day of the year when all bracketologists, human or otherwise, get real feedback.</p>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>If time permits, I hope to build a real bracket, or at least assign regions and pods for the top 4 seed lines, before 6pm tonight. We'll see how that goes.</li>
<li>The #1 seeds are no doubt causing agita for the committee. If Florida, Kansas, and Carolina win, does the Big 10 loser get dropped to the #2 line? If one of those three lose, is the Big 10 loser safe? Do they even take that into account with the game schedule for 3:30 (ET) and the brackets due to CBS by 5:30? Or do any of today's games matter to the bracket, given the complications caused by the various combinations. (<a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/report2007-sundaymorning.html">For the record, as of Sunday morning</a>, my top 4 are Ohio State, Wisconsin, UCLA, and UNC.)</li>
<li>For one day, bubble teams are Wolfpack and Razorback fans. The Pack may have a tough time against the Heels rested, up-tempo style; this will be their fourth game in four days, and their starters have played 83% of their minutes. (The Heels are up 42-34 at the half.) Arkansas is a little more complicated. They may well be in win or lose (I have them as the last team in as of Sunday morning). Might the committee go ahead and put them in regardless? As in chaos theory (and weather forecasting), a small change like switching an at-large team could create big ripples down the bracket.</li>
</ul>

<p>More to follow before the unveiling.</p>
