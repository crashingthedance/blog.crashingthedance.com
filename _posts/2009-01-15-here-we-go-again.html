<p><a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com">Crashing the Dance</a> is back for a fourth season. We have a few new things for you, our loyal reader, this season.</p>

<p>You may have noticed the first site redesign since we launched in 2006. The new design makes it easier to navigate between sections. You can also get a quick glance of what's new each day (and there is something new each and every day) in the new Summary section and the column on the left edge of the page. <a href="mailto:andy@crashingthedance.com">Let me know</a> whether you love it, hate it, or if you just don't care.</p>

<p>You'll just have to wait and see what the other changes are. (Meaning, they are not ready yet.)</p>

<p>Here are a few things to read if you're new to the site, or just to refresh your memory if you've forgotten:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check out the About section on the <a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com">main page</a>. Hopefully that will answer many of your questions. And if you still have questions, <a href="mailto:andy@crashingthedance.com">fire off an e-mail</a> and I'll do my best to answer. I hope to add a section of frequently asked questions to make it easier to get the information you need.</li>
<li>Reviews of the <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2007/02/reviewing_2006.html">2006</a> and <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/03/reviewing-2007.html">2007</a> performance. (The 2008 review will be coming soon.)</li>
<li>Last season I <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/03/sparklines-are.html">added sparklines</a> to the selection and S-Curve sections. Sparklines are data-intense, word-sized graphics meant to be embedded within text. For example, Arkansas's sparkline through today <img height='16' src='http://www.sportvis.com/ctd/2009/sparklineRPI12-2009-01-15.png' />  shows that while they have big wins over Texas and Arkansas, the rest of their performance so far has been weak. (See the <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/03/sparklines-are.html">original post</a> for how to interpret these sparklines.)</li>
<li>If you have some extra time (and really, who doesn't?), you can read through the <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com">blog posts</a> from the last three years. I not only try to explain why things are the way they are, but also provide a lot of commentary about the selection and seeding process in general.
</ul>

<p>Above all, have fun on the site, don't hesitate to get in touch, and enjoy the hoops!</p>
