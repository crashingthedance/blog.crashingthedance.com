<p>The winner of the Duke/UNC on-court skirmish(es) (as opposed to the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3253829">media war of words</a>) and therefore likely ACC champ may not want to buy those Charlotte regional tickets quite yet.</p>

<p>It's been widely accepted as fact that whoever comes out ahead in the ACC between the Devils and Heels would get the backyard Raleigh/Charlotte path. However, if you look at our <a target='_new' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/#distance">distance chart</a>, you'll see that a certain school in Knoxville is closer to Charlotte than to any other regional site.</p>

<p>With a win over Memphis (or even a close loss) Saturday and a strong SEC finish, the Vols could finish ahead of the ACC champ on the S-Curve. Since the regional sites are <a href="http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/story/9183455">assigned in S-Curve order</a>, that would give Tennessee the edge in being assigned to Charlotte.</p>

<p>Interesting, you may say, but that's not even the best part. Either Duke or UNC - but likely not both barring Kansas and UCLA meltdowns - will probably end up as a #1 seed. If Tennessee falls ahead of a #1 seed Duke/UNC on the S-Curve, the Vols would go to Charlotte and Duke/UNC would head west.</p>

<p>When it comes time to assign the #2 seeds to regions, guess who would be closest to Charlotte? That's right - the Duke/UNC victor gets the spoils of heading west and the loser stays home in Charlotte. I wonder how Coach K or Roy will react to that.</p>

<p>Having grown up in the Triangle, I find the irony delicious as a plate of Carolina barbecue (the Eastern NC kind, thank you very much) and hush puppies.</p>
