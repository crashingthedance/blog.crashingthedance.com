<p>Nate Silver, formerly with Baseball Prospectus and fresh off moving his 538 political analysis to the New York Times, jumped into the March Madness fray this year. Mr. Silver used a combination of computer power rankings and seeds, with adjustments for geography, injury, and other factors, to generate <a target="_blank" href="http://ncaabracket.nytimes.com/2011/bracket/men/fivethirtyeight-forecast">probabilities</a> for each team reaching a particular round in the bracket.</p>

<p>Now that we're down to a manageable 16 teams, I thought I'd play around with some of his numbers to calculate the probabilities of some interesting results.</p>

<p>These all assume the outcome of each region is independent. I think my math is right, but feel free to correct me if you notice anything wrong.</p>

<p><b>72.5%</b> probability of a #1 seed winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>18 champs have been #1 seeds - most since seeding began in 1979</p>
<p><b>23.3%</b> probability of three #1 seeds in the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>Three or more #1 seeds have made it four times since seeding began </p>
<p><b>19.4%</b> probability of an Ohio State vs. Kansas final</p>
<p class='indent'>The most likely championship game pairing</p>
<p><b>12.7%</b> probability of #2 seed winning the championship</p>
<p class='indent'>Six champs have been #2 seeds - second most since seeding began</p>
<p><b>10.4%</b> probability of Duke and UNC meeting in the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>Also known as <a target='_blank' href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/story/14844552/dukeunc-potential-in-final-four-just-too-juicy-to-ignore">"The Game That Must Not Be Named"</a></p>
<p><b>5.7%</b> probability of all-Big Ten final (Ohio State vs. Wisconsin)</p>
<p class='indent'>Would be the first since Indiana-Michigan in 1976</p>
<p><b>3.1%</b> probability of #10 seed or lower winning</p>
<p class='indent'>Villanova (#8 seed) in 1985 is the lowest seed to win the championship</p>
<p><b>1.2%</b> probability of a rematch of last year's Duke/Butler championship game</p>
<p class='indent'>A championship game rematch has not happened since 1961 and 1962 (Cincinnati defeated Ohio State both years)</p>
<p><b>0.7%</b> probability of all-SEC final (Kentucky vs. Florida)</p>
<p class='indent'>There has never been an all-SEC final, despite ten championships between three teams </p>
<p><b>0.4%</b> probability of both remaining Big East teams making the Final Four</p>
<p class='indent'>More likely, there is an 87% chance neither will</p>

<p>While <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/basketball/ncaa/mens-tournament/2011/03/16/sheehan.final.four/index.html">Joe Sheehan's scenario</a> is no longer possible, there are still enough non-Big Six conference teams left to make an impact on the Final Four. But how much impact will they make?</p>

<p><b>Probability of a non-major team in he Final Four by region</b></p>
<p><b>Southeast</b> (BYU or Butler) -  <b>32.4%</b></p>
<p><b>West</b> (SDSU) - <b>31.2%</b></p>
<p><b>Southwest</b> (Richmond or VCU) - <b>14.5%</b></p>

<p>Probability of three non-majors in the Final Four - <b>1.5%</b></p>
<p>Probability of no non-major Final Four teams - <b>39.8%</b></p>
<p>Probability of a non-major national champion - <b>8.9%</b></p>

<p>Hey, it could happen.</p>
