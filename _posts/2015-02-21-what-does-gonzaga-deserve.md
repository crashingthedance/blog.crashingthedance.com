The funny thing about #1 seeds is that there are only 4 of them. If there are
more than 4 teams that ["deserve"
one](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/25075398/gonzaga-at-33-1-would-absolutely-deserve-a-no-1-seed-come-march),
guess what happens?

Right now, the [CTD seeding model](http://crashingthedance.com/seeding) says
that Gonzaga's resume does in fact "deserve" a #1 seed. However, so do the
resumes of 5 other teams.

If [Kentucky](http://crashingthedance.com/teams/131),
[Wisconsin](http://crashingthedance.com/teams/326),
[Villanova](http://crashingthedance.com/teams/308) win out, and
[Duke](http://crashingthedance.com/teams/72) and
[Virginia](http://crashingthedance.com/teams/309)
win out until the ACC final, you could easily say each of them also deserves a
#1 seed.

Gonzaga may end up with a #1 seed (and if they do, they'll be follow the
[Seattle to Los Angeles path](http://crashingthedance.com/distance), but if they
win out and don't get a #1 seed, it doesn't mean that they didn't
deserve it.

It's just like at-large selections. There might be more or fewer
than 36 teams that "deserve" spots, but the committee has to pick exactly 36.
