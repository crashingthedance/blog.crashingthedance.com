<p>First, I apologize for the lack of creativity in the design. I'm concentrating on getting something up, and if I have more time I'll tweak the style.</p>

<p>This blog will be my forum for discussing interesting things I notice on the selection and seeding results along with answering any questions and comments you may have. Obviously, I'm a bit late to the party in getting this up a few weeks before Selection Sunday, but hopefully it will be a useful addition to the bracketologists out there.</p>

<p>See the <a href='http://www.crashingthedance.com/'>main site</a> for a description of what I'm trying to do. Questions and comments welcome at dance AT sportvis DOT com.</p>
