<p>Hopefully, this will be the first in an intermittent series of posts poking holes in the popular narratives using facts and data and stuff.</p>

<p>After Ryan Kelly's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/sports/ncaabasketball/ryan-kellys-36-points-lift-duke-over-miami.html" target="_blank">triumphant return</a> Saturday, all people want to talk about is how his return will help the Blue Devils on offense. Indeed, the Devils have been a much better team with with the senior in the lineup. However, using our <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2009/03/accounting-for-injuries.php">Net Efficiency Margin</a> metric, we see that Kelly's absence manifested itself far more on defense than on offense.</p>

<p>All numbers are prior to March 2 game against Miami.</p>

<table border='0'>
<tr style='font-weight:bold; text-align:right;'>
<td style='text-align:left;'>Duke</td><td style='text-align:right;' title='Offensive Net efficiency margin'>Off NEM</td><td style='text-align:right;' title='Defensive Net efficiency margin'>Def NEM</td><td style='text-align:right;' title='Net efficiency margin'>Total NEM</td></tr>
<tr style='text-align:right;'><td style='text-align:left;'>With Kelly (15 games)</td>
<td style='text-align:right;'>16.3</td><td style='text-align:right;'>-17.7</td><td style='text-align:right;'>34.0</td>
</tr>
<tr style='text-align:right;'><td style='text-align:left;'>Without Kelly (13 games)</td>
<td style='text-align:right;'>18.5</td><td style='text-align:right;'>-6.2</td><td style='text-align:right;'>24.7</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In other words, after accounting for tempo and opponent strength Duke was actually slightly better as a team on offense during Kelly's 13-game absence, but they were significantly worse (11.5 points per 100 possessions) on defense. (Lower defensive NEM values are better.)</p>

<p>Let's temper the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/21800003/ryan-kelly-returns-for-duke----and-blue-devils-return-to-elite-">title favorites talk</a> based on a single game where they needed a performance described - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=22724&SPID=1845&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=206579693">by Coach K</a>, no less - as one of the best ever by a Duke player in Cameron to win by one possession at home. However, if they can regain that defensive form and continue to get performances like Kelly's 36-point outburst, the Devils will be contenders in Atlanta.</p>
