<p>Several more bids were doled out, and the big conferences got started Tuesday.</p>

<b>Who clinched yesterday</b>
<ul>
<li>Horizon - <b><a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile34.shtml">Butler</a></b> 59, Wisconsin Milwaukee 44</li>
<li>Sun Belt - <b><a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile13.shtml">Arkansas Little Rock</a></b> 64, North Texas 63</li>
<li>Summit - <b><a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile208.shtml">Oakland</a></b> 90, Oral Roberts 76</li>
</ul>

<b>Who helped themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile225.shtml">Princeton</a></li>
<p>The Tigers forced a one-game playoff with Harvard for the Ivy Leagu's automatic bid by beating Penn at the Palestra. The playoff game will take place Saturday at Yale.</p>
</ul>

<b>Who hurt themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile308.shtml">Villanova</a></li>
<p>Villanova is in no danger of missing the tournament, but their seeding will suffer from the ugly loss to South Florida. The Wildcats have now lost their last five and 10 of 15 after starting 16-1. As expected in the Big East, many of the losses were to good teams, but the margin in some of these should be troubling. After starting with a <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2009/03/accounting-for-injuries.html">NEM</a> of 26.7 through their January 22 win at Syracuse, Villanova has dropped off to 12.9 over their last 12.</p>
</ul>

<b>Who clinches today</b>	
<ul>
<li><b>Big Sky</b> - Montana at Northern Colorado</li>
<li><b>Northeast</b> - Robert Morris at Long Island</li>
</ul>
