<p>You can find plenty of previews of all the Sweet 16 games all across the Interwebs, so I thought I'd just lend some selected insight where I can.</p>

<p><b>(2) Duke vs. (3) Villanova</b> - East Regional, Boston</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Contrary to their reputation, Duke has become much more offense-centered since the insertion of Elliot Williams into the starting lineup February 19 at St. John's. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&amp;id=3927360" target='_blank'>Conventional wisdom</a> says Williams has had more impact on defense, but that's not the case at all.</p> 
<p>In starting 21-5, the Devils averaged 12.9 offensive NEM and -16.5 defensive NEM. (NEM refresher <a target='_blank' href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2009/03/accounting-for-injuries.html">here</a>; larger offensive NEM is better, smaller defensive NEM is better.) After the change their offensive NEM has improved to 22.5, but their defensive NEM has dropped significantly to -3.0. In other words, the Devils' defense has been performing somewhere between that of <i>Iowa and Northeastern</i>.</p>
<p>Other than a four game stretch from Jan. 28 to Feb. 7, their offense has actually been very good: 15.2 NEM before, 1.3 NEM during the slump, and 21.1 NEM after. Don't necessarily blame Williams for the drop in defense; the Devils' drop in defense actually goes back a few games before the Williams change. Before the Feb. 4 Clemson game, Duke played defense at a phenomenal -19.5 NEM; since then it's dropped dramatically to -2.4 NEM. Keep in mind this has nothing to do with conference play; the net efficiency margin factors out strength of opponent.</p></li>

<li>Villanova probably wants to slow it down. Their defensive efficiency <a href="http://kenpom.com/expsked.php?team=Villanova&y=2009" target='_blank'>degrades significantly</a> at faster paces, much moreso than their offensive efficiency. Duke's offensive and defensive efficiency ratings each <a href="http://kenpom.com/expsked.php?team=Duke&y=2009" target='_blank'>slightly improve with faster tempo</a>, so a slower pace would benefit the Wildcats.</li>

<li>Control over the boards, particularly after Villanova misses, will be important. Duke's defense is <a href="http://kenpom.com/expsked.php?team=Duke&y=2009" target='_blank'>highly dependent</a> on how well they control the glass, especially defensively. The Devils are only <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?y=2009&amp;team=Duke" target='_blank'>middle of the pack</a> in D-1 (though certainly not the <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?y=2009&amp;team=Syracuse" target='_blank'>worst remaining team</a>) in allowing offensive rebounds. They are much better on the offensive glass than on the defensive end, but their offensive rebound rate has little correlation</a> with their offensive efficiency.</li>

<li>Villanova's offensive efficiency is <a href="http://kenpom.com/expsked.php?team=Villanova&y=2009" target='_blank'>more sensitive</a> to their turnover rate than is <a href="http://kenpom.com/expsked.php?team=Duke&y=2009" target='_blank'>Duke's</a>, so they need to take care of the ball. Duke is <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?y=2009&amp;team=Duke" target='_blank'>very good</a> at turning you over, so this battle could be key.</li>
</ul>
