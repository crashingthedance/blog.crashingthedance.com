<p>It's homestretch time, with three more days to go. All conference tournaments have started, and 18 of the 31 automatic bids are still up for grabs.</p>

<b>Who clinched yesterday</b>
<p>Nobody</p>

<b>Who helped themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile55.shtml">Colorado</a></li>
<p>Completed the triple sweep of likely at-large Kansas State. With additional wins against Texas and Missouri, they may be hard for the committee to ignore.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile96.shtml">Georgia</a></li>
<p>Their win over a putrid Auburn team doesn't clinch anything, but it keeps them in the hunt.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile207.shtml">Notre Dame</a></li>
<p>If they weren't in the discussion for a #1 seed, they are now.</p>
</ul>

<b>Who hurt themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile296.shtml">UAB</a></li>
<p>The top seed in the CUSA tourney goes down, and they were probably <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2011/03/whos-overvalued.html">overvalued by the selection model</a> anyway.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile30.shtml">BYU</a></li>
<p>A close win against a bad TCU team can't help their post-Davies resume. Next up is their nemesis, New Mexico. I'm close to applying a seed drop based on how they've looked without Davies.</p>
</ul>

<b>Who clinches today</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Patriot League</b> - Lafayette at Bucknell</li>
</ul>

<b>Other big games today</b>
<p>Basically, everyone who is still on the bubble and still playing has a big game today. This includes Clemson, Virginia Tech, Michigan, Georgia, Penn State, Michigan State, Memphis, and Alabama, to name a few. The bubble is so weak and fluid this year, it would be a bad idea to give the committee a reason to doubt you.</p>
