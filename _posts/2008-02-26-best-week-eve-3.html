<p>Selection Sunday is approaching. Let's get to it. As usual, all data is through Sunday's games.</p>

<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Up</b></p>

<p><b>Miami</b> - (was #10 seed; now #7 seed)</p>

<p>Despite a good but not great non-conference start (13-1 and #36 non-conf RPI), most did not even have the 'Canes on the bubble a few weeks ago with their 2-6 record in the ACC. <a target='_new' href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?y=2008&amp;team=Miami%20FL&amp;t=p">Four strong wins</a> (including a <a target='_new' href="http://hurricanesports.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/stats/2007-2008/um0220.html">roller coaster over Duke</a>) later, they are solidly in the field. I wouldn't say they are a lock, but they are almost on equal footing with Clemson. With a win this week in Littlejohn, they could certainly claim to have passed the Tigers.

<p><b>Kent State</b> - (was #12 seed; now #9)</p>

<p>The Bracket Busters have won six in a row and <a target='_new' href="http://www.kentstatesports.com/fls/11400/Statistics/M_Basketball/2007-08/mb022308.htm">came from nine down</a> to take down a good St. Mary's team in California. With their impressive seven RPI Top 100 wins and 13-3 record against RPI Top 200 opponents, the Golden Flashes may be in without winning the MAC tournament. With that #47 Sagarin ranking, they may want to just to be safe.</p>

<p><b>Villanova</b> - (was out; now #11 seed)</p>

<p>After losing five straight and 6 of 7 and <a target='_new' href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/01/best-week-eve-1.html">dropping out of the CTD field before the Super Bowl</a>, the Wildcats have played their way back. They shouldn't get too comfortable yet with <a target='_new' href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?y=2008&amp;team=Villanova&amp;t=p">two rough games coming</a>. A win in one of those or a showing in the Big East semis may be enough, but with 9 Big East teams currently in the <a target='_new' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/#seed">CTD bracket</a>, that's easier said than done.</p>

<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Down</b></p>

<p><b>Texas A&M</b> - (was #7 seed; now #9)</p>

<p>Three straight bad losses (close home losses to non-tourney Nebraska and Oklahoma State and a bad road loss to an impressive Texas team) have the Aggies continuing their drop. Certainly no more gimmes in the <a target='_new' href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?y=2008&amp;team=Texas%20A%26M&amp;t=p">remaining schedule</a>, so they better right the ship or it won't be seeding they should worry about.</p>

<p><b>Maryland</b> - (was #12 seed; now out)</p>

<p>Who's fearing the turtle? After reaching 6-3 and a solid 3rd place in the ACC, the Terps have dropped 3 or 4 and dropped off the <a target='_new' href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/#bubble25">CTD bubble</a>. <a target='_new' href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?y=2008&amp;team=Maryland&amp;t=p">Three tough games</a> (two on the road) await; taking two of three, therefore putting the Terps above .500 in the ACC, would make them breath a bit easier. Still, they may need an additional win or two in the ACC tourney to completely come out of their shell.</p>

<p><b>Rhode Island</b> - (was #9 seed; now out)</p>

<p>Apparently trying to one-up the Aggies, the Rams have lost five of six. All <a target='_new' href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?team=Rhode%20Island">remaining games</a> are against (essentially) sub-100 RPI teams, so an automatic bid may be their only hope.</p>
