<p>I wouldn't be so quick to assume that Duke will do the same thing to Butler on the offensive glass that they did to West Virginia.</p>

<p>Coming into Saturday's game, West Virginia <a href="http://kenpom.com/factors.php?t=d&amp;s=7" target="_blank">ranked 124th</a> in the country defensive rebound rate, allowing opposing offenses to grab 31.6% of the available boards. <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=Butler&amp;y=2010" target="_blank">Butler</a>, on the other hand, ranked 14th in the country before their win over Michigan State. Even if you adjust for the level of competition, allowing only 27.6% is not too shabby.</p>

<p>In fact, Butler ranks in the top 100 in each of the three defensive four factor categories where <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=Duke&amp;y=2010" target="_blank">Duke is strongest</a> - offensive rebounding %, effective FG% (68th), turnover % (74th). Again, you have to take somewhat into consideration that Butler's competition is slightly weaker, but there's no doubt that as <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2010/03/sweet-16-preview-butler-vs-syracuse.html" target="_blank">I wrote last week</a>, Butler's strength - and their best hope for winning Monday - lies with their D.</p>
