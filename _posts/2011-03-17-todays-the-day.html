<p>Once everyone has played a game, I'll start posting <a href="http://tourney.si.com/2010/03/17/bracket-math-choosing-a-final-four/">net efficiency margin</a> (NEM) results as a tempo-free and opponent-strength-independent team performance metric. If you still need some help with your bracket, here are a few teasers.</p>

<p>All raw efficiency data is from the sublime <a href='http://www.kenpom.com' target="_blank">kenpom.com</a>. I used the ratings through last Sunday's games to make the comparisons.</p>

<p><b>(6) St. John's vs. (11) Gonzaga</b> - Southeast region, Denver pod</p>

<p><img src='http://archive.crashingthedance.com/images/r1-stjohns-gonzaga.png' ></p>

<p>These are two teams heading in opposite directions, and it doesn't get any better for St. John's without D.J. Kennedy.</p>

<p><b>(6) Cincinnati vs. (11) Missouri</b> - West region, Washington pod</p>

<p><img src='http://archive.crashingthedance.com/images/r1-cincy-missouri.png' ></p>

<p>Another case of teams heading in different directions, Cincinnati's Big East tourney loss notwithstanding. Missouri's downward trend has been going for a while.</p>

<p><b>(6) Georgetown vs. (11) Virginia Commonwealth</b> - Southwest region, Chicago pod</p>

<p><img src='http://archive.crashingthedance.com/images/georgetown-splits.png' ></p>

<p>Georgetown is expectd to regain the services of Chris Wright, who went out with a broken left hand on February 223. Since then, the Hoyas have not been themselves. Their NEM trend (blue is offense - higher is better - and red is defense - lower is better) shows the dropoff has come almost entirely on offense, so if Wright can step back in the Hoyas could make some noise.</p>
