<p>This week's edition is limited to teams in the top ten of the all-time winningest Division I programs.</p>

<p>All numbers through games of Sunday, February 15.</p>

<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Up</b></p>
<p><b>North Carolina</b> (#1 seed last week; #1 this week)</p>
<p>After falling to as low as #6 on the S-Curve after losing to Boston College and Wake Forest, the Heels are back up to #2 after winning nine straight. This week, they survived a first half flurry of threes and a "<a href="http://blogs.newsobserver.com/decock/five-thoughts-on-carolina-duke" target='_blank'>ridiculously slippery floor</a>" to beat formerly #1 seeded Duke, and Sunday survived a <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/viewcast/2009/02/15/index.html?contestId=52621&amp;vendorId=200902150355&amp;vendorVisitTeam=413&amp;vendorHomeTeam=355&amp;pageType=recap" target='_blank'>ridiculously hot</a> <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/kevin_armstrong/02/13/jack.mcclinton/index.html" target='_blank'>Jack McClinton</a> to top Miami.

<p><b>Kentucky</b> (out last week; #11 this week)</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2009/02/best-week-ever-inaugural-edition.html">As predicted</a>, Kentucky re-enters the field after 10 days out. Jodie Meeks continues to dazzle, dropping 45 in a 79-63 win at Arkansas. The Wildcats sit at 18-7 (7-3 SEC), which puts them in better shape than they were <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=Kentucky&amp;y=2008">last year</a>. With the parity (or whatever word you choose) in the SEC this year, the Cats may be as likely to finish 7-9 as 13-3.</p>

<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Down</b></p>
<p><b>Duke</b> (#1 seed last week; #2 this week)</p>
<p>Is it <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=Duke&amp;y=2007" target='_blank'>deja vu</a> <a href="http://kenpom.com/team.php?team=Duke&amp;y=2008" target='_blank'>all over again</a> for Duke? Only time will tell, but the Devils have fallen to the #2 line after peaking at #1 on the S-Curve only three weeks ago. With 4 of their last 6 on the road (and Wake Forest and Florida State in Cameron), they need to right the ship to avoid falling more.</p>

<p><b>UCLA</b> (#3 seed last week; #5 this week)</p>
<p>Despite <a href="http://www.basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=536" target='_blank'>a highly efficient and underrated offense</a>, the Bruins lost a pair on the road to the <a href="http://www.netstate.com/states/intro/az_intro.htm" target='_blank'>Copper State contingent</a> of the Pac 10. In fact, 4 of the country's top 10 offenses (by <a href="http://kenpom.com/stats.php?s=8">adjusted offensive efficiency</a>), including UCLA and the aforementioned Arizona pair, reside in the Pac 10.</p>
