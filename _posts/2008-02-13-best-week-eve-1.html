<p>Obviously, as this is late, I didn't have time for a proper update this week. Here's an abbreviated look at who's hot and not. It's hard to separate the effect of the week's games from the <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/02/wha-happened.html">recent change</a> in the CTD model, so I won't even try. All data is through Sunday's games, even though, yes, it is now Wednesday night.</p>

<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Up</b></p>

<p><b>Maryland</b> and <b>Houston</b> (were out, now #12 seed) - Barely on the radar last week, each was helped now that CTD <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/02/wha-happened.html">considers</a> conference RPI and games +/- .500. </p> 

<p><b>Purdue</b> (was #12 seed, now #7) - The committee will have a tough task weighing Purdue's gaudy conference record with their #156 non-conference RPI.</p>

<p><b>Louisville</b> (was #9 seed, now #5) - Two big wins last week puts the Cardinals into a protected seed.</p>

<p style='font-size:larger;'><b>Down</b></p>

<p><b>Oklahoma</b> (was #8 seed, now out) - Injuries have taken their toll on the Sooners, as will their loss to Big XII cellar dweller Colorado. Inconsistency has been a problem (<a href="http://kenpom.com/rate.php?s=Consistency">ranked #308</a> through Tuesday) - they're not as young as <a href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?y=2008&amp;team=Kansas%20St.&amp;t=p">some</a> Big XII teams having consistency issues, but their best player is a freshman.</p>

<p><b>Miami (FL)</b> (was #9 seed, now out) - Now that CTD <a href="http://blog.crashingthedance.com/2008/02/wha-happened.html">considers</a> conference RPI and games +/- .500, the Canes were hurt by their conference RPI (ranked 72nd) and record (3-6) as much as their performance last week.</p>

<p><b>Syracuse</b> (was #10 seed, now out) - That bubble mark imprinted on their Orange backsides must be real painful right about now. Their non-conference profile is OK (non-conf RPI #27), but their conference performance (RPI #73, record 6-5) and 1-5 record against RPI Top 50 need some work. With a chance to address both in their <a href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?y=2008&amp;team=Syracuse&amp;t=p">upcoming schedule</a>, they may have no room for complaints if they're left out this year.</p> 

<p><b>Ole Miss</b> (was #6 seed, now #10) - The free fall continues (<a href="http://kenpom.com/sked.php?y=2008&amp;team=Mississippi&amp;t=p">lost 4 of 5 and 5 of 8</a>), and their conference r&eacute;sum&eacute; (conference RPI #85, 3-5 record) ain't helping. They can help the record part with some relatively easy upcoming games.</p>

<p><b>Marquette</b> (was #4 seed, now #8) - I think that drop may be a bit harsh, given that they lost to two good teams, but the 9 point drop (16th to 25th) in the coaches poll took its toll. They could also use a few more good wins, with a 2-6 record against the RPI Top 50.</p>
