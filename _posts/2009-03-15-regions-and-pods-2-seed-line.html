<p>5. Memphis - They can't play in Memphis, so the next closest region is the Midwest, in the Kansas City pod.</p>
<p>6. Duke - They'd either be in the East or South. Since UNC is already in Memphis, they go to the East, in the Greensboro pod.</p>
<p>7. Michigan State - They're closer to the South (Memphis), but for region balance purposes we'll move them to the West, in the Minneapolis pod.</p>
<p>8. Oklahoma - The only slot left is in the South, in the Kansas City pod.</p>

<p>After this, it gets tricky.</p>
