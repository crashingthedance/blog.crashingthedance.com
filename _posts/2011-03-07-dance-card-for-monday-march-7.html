<p>Another four bids are up for grabs today, but otherwise it's a slow Monday. Six days to Selection Sunday.</p>

<b>Who clinched yesterday</b>
<ul>
<li>Missouri Valley - <b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile117.shtml">Indiana State</a></b> 60, Missouri State 56</li>
</ul>

<b>Who helped themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile267.shtml">St. Mary's</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile100.shtml">Gonzaga</a></li>
<p>CtD has each in as of today, but neither could have afforded a bad loss in the WCC tournament. The loser of today's championship game still isn't safe.</p>
</ul>

<b>Who hurt themselves yesterday?</b>
<ul>
<li>Conference top seeds</li>
<p>It was a bad day for several conference tourney #1 seeds. Fairfield (MAAC), George Mason (CAA), Vermont (America East), Missouri State (MVC) lost in their conference tournaments. Among those, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile93.shtml">George Mason</a> is the only team with a realistic chance at an at-large bid. As of today, the Patriots are in the field</p>
</ul>

<b>Who clinches today</b>
<ul>
<li><b>CAA</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile310.shtml">VCU</a> vs <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile213.shtml">Old Dominion</a></li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Metro Atlantic</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile268.shtml">St. Peter's</a> vs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile118.shtml">Iona</a></li>
<p></p>
<li><b>Southern</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile329.shtml">Wofford</a> vs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile54.shtml">College of Charleston</a></li>
<p></p>
<li><b>WCC</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile267.shtml">St. Mary's</a> vs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile100.shtml">Gonzaga</a> </li>
<p></p>
