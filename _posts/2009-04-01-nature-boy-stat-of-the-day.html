<p>While this year's Final Four doesn't have quite the seed unanimity as 2008, there is still a chance for some seed history.</p>

<p>Since the tournament expanded to 64 teams (65 now) in 1985, no national champion has played against the highest-seeded possible team all six games along the way. For example, this would mean a #1 seed would play a #16 in the first round, a #8 in the second round, a #4 in the regional semi-final, a #2 in the regional final, and #1 seeds in the national semi-final and championship games.</p>

<p>Should Villanova defeat #1 seeds North Carolina Saturday and Connecticut Monday, they would be the first team to accomplish this feat. The Wildcats got to the Final Four by taking out #14 American, #6 UCLA, #2 Duke, and #1 Pittsburgh - each was the highest possible seed that a #3 could have played at each round.</p>

<p>Coincidentally (or <a target='_blank' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_(song)">ironically?</a>), the only championship team that has faced the highest-possible seed in even 5 of their 6 games is Villanova's Saturday semi-final opponent. By facing #2 seed Kansas instead of a #1 seed in the national semi-final,  North Carolina failed to fulfill the Ric Flair creed in 1993.</p>

<p style='font-size: smaller;font-style: italic;'>To be the man, you gotta beat the man. Woooooo!</p>

<p>Regardless of championship game opponent, the sum of the Wildcats' opponent seeds for all six tournament games would be no worse than 27 if they win Monday night. That would be the lowest such value since a certain <a target='_blank' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament">#8 seed in 1985</a> faced opponents with combined seeds of 20 (including #2 seed North Carolina) en route to the championship.</p>

<p>If the Wildcats win their second NCAA championship Monday night, they certainly will have beat the man to be the man. Woo(oooo), indeed.</p>
