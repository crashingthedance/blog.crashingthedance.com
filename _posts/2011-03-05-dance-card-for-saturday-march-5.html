<p>Each day (more or less) over the next eight days before Selection Sunday we'll take a look back at the previous day and a look forward at the next.</p>

<b>Who clinches today</b>

<ul>
<li><b>Atlantic Sun</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile198.shtml">North Florida</a> vs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile21.shtml">Belmont</a> (Macon, Georgia)</li>
<p>Belmont's profile has some at-large characteristics, but they're not quite in as of todoay. A loss would certainly keep them out.</p>
<li><b>Big South</b> - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile181.shtml">UNC Asheville</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile52.shtml">Coastal Carolina</a></li>
<p>The Chanticleers have a chance for revenge at home after UNC Asheville's Matt Dickey hit a three pointer at the buzzer to give the Bulldogs a win ten days ago.</p>
<li><b>Ivy League</b></li>
<p>This one has an asterisk. If <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile225.shtml">Princeton</a> wins, they clinch the regular season championsihp and the Ivy's automatic bid. If <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile104.shtml">Harvard</a> wins, they clinch at worst a tie for first place and put pressure on Princeton to win at Penn next week to force a one-game playoff.</p>
</ul>

<b>Other big games today</b>

<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile72.shtml">Duke</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile194.shtml">North Carolina</a></li>
<p>The outright regular season championship and first seed in the ACC Tournament are at stake in Chapel Hill. Duke seems likely to be placed in the Charlotte pod, but the Heels could make a claim for the other spot with a win today and strong showing next week.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile164.shtml">Michigan State</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile163.shtml">Michigan</a></li>
<p>Despite their troubles this year, the Spartans are closer to an at-large bid than are their in-state rivals. A win at home would bring the Wolverines even with Michigan State at .500 in the Big Ten. A loss probably means the NIT.</p>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile331.shtml">Wyoming</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile30.shtml">BYU</a></li>
<p>BYU has precious few chances to show that Wednesday's 18 point home loss to New Mexico doesn't represent the new normal without Brandon Davies.</p>
<li>Horizon semifinals (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile305.shtml">Valparaiso</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile305.shtml">UW Milwaukee</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile51.shtml">Cleveland State</a> vs. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashingthedance.com/profiles/2011/profile34.shtml">Butler</a>)</li>
<p>UW Milwaukee surprisingly claimed the top seed and home court in the Horizon tourney, but today's semi Cleveland State and Butler has the only two teams with realistic at-large chance. The loser is probably NIT-bound, and the winner may still have to claim the automatic bid on the road.</p>
</ul>
