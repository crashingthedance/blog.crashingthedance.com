<p>This is a placeholder for the live blog during the selection show. Good luck to all.</p>

<p><b>5:59</b> - I'll probably go back and forth between here and <a href="http://twitter.com/crashthedance" target="_blank">my Twitter feed</a>, so be sure to check both!</p>

<p><b>6:01</b> - Here we go, boys and girls.</p>

<p><b>6:02</b> - Kansas is the overall #1. No surprise there. CtD wife suggests that our 4-month old pick a bracket this year. He'll probably beat all of us.</p>

<p><b>6:04</b> - Off to a good start. Got all #1 seeds in order.</p>

<p><b>6:06</b> - Clark Kellogg's metaphors are off to a great start. Peeling the onion, indeed.</p>

<p><b>6:25</b> - Through two regions, one at-large miss.</p>

<p><b>6:30</b> - Through three regions, one at-large miss. 42 of 49 (86%) within 1 seed line (85% last year), so on good pace.</p>

<p><b>6:45</b> - Preliminary results: Fifth straight year of improvement. 33 of 34 at-large correct, 56 of 65 within one seed line.</p>
